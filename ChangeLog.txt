IMPROVEMENTS
   * Add choices for scaling of powder pattern graphs: x as 2theta/tof,
     1/d or 2pi/d ; y as I, sqrt(I) or log10(I)
   * Compilation for windows is now done using the free (as in 'free as
     a beer') compiler Visual C++ 2005. Large speed improvement.
   * Fox can be compiled without GUI under *nix, using "make Fox-nogui"
     removing the requirement for wxGTK on *nix servers.
   * Support for large Molecules (1000's of atoms) - these *must* be
     treated as rigid bodies

     to avoid compilation issues for user without root access.

BUG FIXES
   * Avoid creating H-H bonds when converting ZScatterer to a Molecule

#### 1.6.0.2 - december 2003
NEW FEATURES
   * Added the export to a POV-Ray file to create a Ray-traced
     view of the 3D Crystal window, with support for both Crystal
     structure and Fourier maps.
   * Added more user control on the fexibility of a Molecule:
      - Added "Rigid Body" and "User-Chosen Free Torsion" choices
        for the flexibility model of the Molecule.
      - Also added an option to disable the optimisation of the
        orientation of the Molecule (only useful for "Rigid Body" mode)
      - Give access to the delta and sigma parameters to calculate
        restraints, although users are HIGHLY advised not to change
        the default values unless they really know what they are doing
      Also, a Molecule will by default be less flexible than before
   * Added import of DSN6 Fourier maps, which can be created by
     forplot in GSAS.
   * Reverted to using GLUT under Linux to display atom labels in
     the OpenGL window, as some graphical drivers did not fare well
     with the new method.
   * Ability to remove several atoms/bonds/angles at the same time.
     When removing a bond, offer to remove the bond angles and
     dihedral angles using that bond.
   * Added reflection labels on the powder pattern graphical display.
   * Speed improvements by avoiding (more) recomputations.
   * Fox now uses wxWindows 2.4.x (no support for versions <2.4).
   * Added support for Cobalt X-Ray tube. Also, correctly save
     X-Ray tube parameters when they have been entered manually.
   * Fourier maps with negative contour values will now be highlighted
     towards negative values, for Fobs-Fcalc maps display.

BUG FIXES
   * The position of peaks on a powder pattern was randomly displaced
     by up to +/-2 pixels for each reflection. This could be serious
     for patterns recorded with a low resolution relatively to the
     peak widths, although the use of "integrated" Chi^2 and R-factors
     reduced the gravity of this bug. (thanks Michal Husak for
     serious testing and reporting)
   * In the CIF output, some atoms were wrongly labeled as being
     overlapping with another identical element.
   * In the graphical display of powder patterns, improve the precison
     of the display.
   * Correct center of view coordinates when the center of the displayed
     structure is not at (0.5,0.5,0.5)


#### 1.5 - june 2003
NEW FEATURES-MAJOR CHANGES
   * The optimization will now use log(likelihood) as a criterion:
     in practice, this means that the Chi^2 statistics are used
     rather than the user-chosen cost functions. The likelihood
     can sometimes be parametrized in the objects (crystal, pattern),
     but not any more in the Global Optimization objects.
   * Added a Molecule class, which suprsedes the ZScatterer approach
     The scatterer is defined by a list of atoms, and restraints
     (bond lengths, angles and dihedral angles) to specify the
     geometry. This gives more flexibility, allows a better
     convergence and allows to correctly define cyclic molecules.
   * Added the ability to define a statistical positionnal error
     for atoms, which will be taken into account following Maximum
     Likelihood principles (ML field in ScatteringPowers), of course
     with a significant amount of approximations to be computationnaly
     friendly.
   * CIF output (with the help of Brian Toby).

OTHER NEW FEATURES
   * Faster computation when using integrated profiles for powder
     pattern objects
   * Error bars are now displayed on the Powder Pattern graphical
     display.
   * Further improvements of the Fourier maps display (mostly from
     Brian Toby)
   * A cursor can be displayed in the center of the 3D Crystal view,
     its coordinates are displayed at the bottom of the window, with
     the value of Fourier maps (if any)
   * Added atom labels in 3D Crystal view (right-click menu to
     deactivate)
   * In OpenGL view of a Crystal structure, shift-dragging with left
     mouse button now correctly changes the center of the view without
     changing the rotation center.
   * Changed lighting model in 3D Crystal view
   * Added the ability to save structure factors from a
     DiffractionSingleCrystal object, including detailed contributions
     from different elements (useful for anomalous diffraction
     experiments)

BUG FIXES
   * Fixed bug when exporting to a Fenske-Hall z-matrix, the 4th atom
     was always repeated twice
   * Overall ZScatterer occupancy is now correctly taken into account.
   * Auto-save of xml files will now use local time rather than gmt.


#### 1.3 - december 2002
NEW FEATURES
   * Added a contribution from Michael Y. Polyakov, (working with
     Brian Toby) to display Fourier maps exported from GSAS in
     Fox (use right-click when displaying 3D structure to import).
   * Added scattering power for a sphere, e.g. to modelize a
     disordered fullerene.
   * Added the option to use pseudo-crystallographic symmetry in a
     Crystal structure (i.e. use a spacegroup which is not allowed
     by the unit cell). Could be useful for phase transitions.
   * Added data format for FullProf formats 4 (synchrotron) and
     6 (multi-detector, LLB G42)
   * Now more than 100 atoms can be displayed in a ZScatterer unit.
   * Added the ability to set relative limits on all scatterer
     translations from their current positions.
   * Added the ability to run Fox without the graphical interface,
     once all objects to be optimized have been setup and saved in
     a xml file.
   * shift-dragging with left mouse button allows to change center of
     the 3D Crystal view.

BUG FIXES
   * Fix serious bug in the dtermination of systematic extinctions,
     which lead to missing reflections for (body|face)-centered
     spacegroups with a center of symmetry not on the origin
     (e.g. for Fd3m (Si,...))
   * Fixed various bugs in the display and update of powder patterns

#### 1.2 - august 2002
NEW FEATURES
   * FOX now supports Preferred Orientation, using the March-Dollase
     model. The texture parameters can be searched ab initio.
   * The 3D display of the crystal structure is now also refreshed
     automatically under WinNT and above (still much less responsive
     than under Linux -hint,hint).
   * The default size of crystal structure and powder pattern are more
     reasonable under windows.
   * New atoms in ZScatterer are now given a sensible default name,
     ScattPowName+number of the atom.
   * The wavelength is now directly displayed in the window, rather
     than exclusively through a menu.
   * Added ability to duplicate scatterers in Crystal.
   * Powder diffraction pattern keeps zoomed during optimization.

BUG FIXES
   * The atom names in ZScatterer are now validated without the
     'enter' key being hit.
   * Adding atoms in a z-matrix scatterer does not crash anymore.
   * removing a scatterer (or any object...) after running an
     optimisation, does not crash any more when optimization is
     relaunched (the parameter list is now correctly rebuilt).
   * Now correctly zooming when the dragged area goes beyond
     2theta limits.

#### 1.1.2 - 2002/02/18
License changed to the GNU General Public License.
NEW FEATURES
   * Added a maximum value of sin(theta)/lambda for diffraction
     data objects. All data above is ignored.
   * Added an *experimental* option in single crystal data for
     twinned data, to work on the sum of metrically-equivalent
     reflections. Entirely untested (contact me to use it !)
	* Some parameter are automatically fixed for global optimizations
	  (unit cell, background & profile parameters).
   * Fox will write a few messages for some key events
     (importing data, creating spacegroup,...)

BUG FIXES
   * The dynamical occupancy correction now begins for interatomic
     distances below 1A, and proceeds to full correction for .1A
     (before that 2 and .8A where used (why?))
   * Spacegroup and Unit Cell values can now be changed even if
     scattering data has already been computed, without crash.
   * Importing a Z-Matrix would give the 3rd and 4th atoms the same
	  number, and if atoms were of the same type, both atoms would
	  have the same name in the .xml saved file, and would crash
     on reloading. Molecules thus created need to be re-imported.

#### 1.1.1 - 2002/01/17
BUG FIXES
   * Under windows, the global optimization lead to a crash after
     some random time.
   * Under windows, clicking on some part of a powder pattern graph
     would make Fox crash

#### 1.1 - 2002/01/8
NEW FEATURES
   * Now it is possible to import Z-matrices to build a molecule
     structure (eg a Z-matrix file can be generated from a .pdb file
     using babel, and then imported into Fox)
   * Added integrated R and RW factors as new cost functions (thus
     less sensitive to badly defined profiles). Unless you have *very*
     good profile parameters, I recommend using the integrated Rw as
     a cost function.
   * Now it is recommended to choose an "exponential" schedule for
     the amplitude, from 8 to .125, and a "smart" schedule for the
     temperature. This should be optimized for *all* experiments,
     so that users don't have to guess the right choices.
   * It is no longer necessary to validate all input by hitting the
     'return' key (which was *very* annoying)
   * Ability to zoom on the powder pattern graph, using the left button
     (double-click to unzoom)
   * Possibility to reduce the part of the displayed unit cell in 3D
     view (use the popup menu with right-click)
   * Significant speed improvement.
   * The Parallel Tempering algorithm has been tuned to yield a higher
     success ratio.
   * Possibility to used single-crystal data (eg extracted intensities)
     for crystal structure optimization (honest crystallographer's note:
     if you have high quality extracted intensities, try direct methods
     first...)
   * Added interface for 2theta zero/displacement/transparency
     parameters in a Powder Pattern object
   * Added an overall temperature factor (Biso) for each crystalline
     phase in powder diffraction (also available in single crystal).
   * new examples for organic molecules (potassium tartrate and
     cimetidine with powder & extracted pseud-single crystal
     intensities)
   * The program now forbids to check lattice or profile parameters
     for a global optimization.

-LINUX:
   * Now using a distribution from source using the wxWindows RPM, which
   * should make things easier under Linux.

-BUG FIX:
   * under linux, the antibump cost function was not properly restored
	  from an xml file (preventing merging of identical atoms)
	* Changing the spacegroup (and thus extinction rules) will now
	  will re-generate the list of reflections for powder diffraction.
	  Same if the lattice parameters or the wavelength has changed.
   * a number of minor bugfixes...

#### 1.0.1 - 2001/10/15
-BUG FIX:
   * corrected minimum FWHM for profiles from .001 to .00001 radians

#### 1.0 - 2001/10/15
-NEW FEATURES
   * support for multiple crystalline phases in Powder Diffraction (you
      can refine several phases from one pattern ...provided you can
      index them)
   * the Windows version now displays a console to give a better idea
     about what the program is doing.
   * Import of Sietronics data files (.cpi)
   * Linux binary version also available for glibc 2.1

-BUG FIXES:
   * removed another bug in ZMatrix interpretation, which prevented the
     correct coordinates to be generated when using mono/triclinic unit
     cells (thanks Mark Edgar).
   * the program will no longer crash when importing data with null or
     negative points.
   * U,V and W parameters leading to negative profile width will no
     longer crash the program (profile forced to be strictly positive)
   * various cosmetic bugs

#### 0.9.1 Beta - 2001/09/20
-NEW FEATURES
   * Added menus to change limits globally in a ZScatterer(bond,angles)
   * Now the pivot atom (around which the ZScatterer is rotated, and
     which corresponds to the displayed x,y,z position of the
     ZScatterer) is saved in the .xml file. It can also be changed
     from a menu.
   * Limits can be changed individually for all parameters, using a
     popu menu: right-click on the parameter name to get the local menu

-BUG FIXES:
   * removed a nasty bug in ZMatrix interpretation, which prevented
     the correct coordinates to be generated  for chains longer than 3
     atoms. Did not affect polyhedras... (thanks Yuri Andreev)
